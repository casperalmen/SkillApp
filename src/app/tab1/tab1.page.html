  <p> Any skill that is useful in your life can be considered a life skill. Life skills vary by culture and 
      by a person’s age. A mature adult is expected to have stronger life skills than a younger person. <br> 
      However, there are certain life skills that almost every employer looks for when hiring new employees.
      Companies look for job candidates who can handle common challenges that arise at work, and life skills 
      help employees do just that. <br> <br>
      People with strong life skills are considered to have maturity and professionalism. Those with strong 
      life skills are less likely to be reactive, and they are aware of their surroundings and themselves. 
      Life skills are critical to management and leadership positions. </p>

    <h4> Skills that you need for the future </h4>
